### Open Access to Network Card DMA Firmware
ACE has recently restricted many RTL-type devices, including network card DMA firmware. Importantly, this technology has become **publicly accessible**, allowing anyone with basic technical knowledge to quickly learn and create it. As a result, prices for these firmware solutions remain relatively affordable, generally within the **100-180 USD** range. This applies to both Killer cards and other models, so prices should not vary significantly.


### Recognizing False Claims and High-Price Tactics
Some individuals may attempt to mislead new players by claiming that open-source network card devices, often with additional modifications, are exclusive "internal" products. They may also assert that their versions are unique or private. 

However:
- **Unique Firmware:** ACE is likely to soon gather data on all such devices. Each firmware version requires unique encoding, ensuring distinct versions for each user.
- **Open and Accessible Technology:** With the right emulation skills, anyone can achieve stability and reliability in these devices. There is no "private" firmware—only **thousands of lines of code** accessible to those who seek it.

### Scam Alert
If you’ve paid **300 USD** for network card emulation firmware, there’s a strong chance you’ve been overcharged, as this technology is now widely accessible.

## Purpose
The purpose of releasing this firmware is to harmonize the device and prevent further resale, as many individuals are reselling this series of firmware for around $200.

## Important Note
Currently, many people are cloning this library and imitating our ID to defraud others.

## Resources
We will provide compilation tutorials to assist users in using this firmware.
